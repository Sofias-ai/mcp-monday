   # On Windows
   mcpMondayVenv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Unix/macOS
   source mcpMondayVenv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Run the setup script or install dependencies manually:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use the setup script
   python setup.py
   
   # Option 2: Install dependencies manually
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```
   MONDAY_API_KEY=your_monday_api_key
   MONDAY_BOARD_ID=your_board_id
   ```
   
   You can get your API key in Monday.com ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí API

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

- `monday_config.py`: Configuration and initialization of MCP and Monday.com

   - Parameters: `field` (field name/ID), `value` (value to search for)
   
3. **delete_board_items**: Deletes items from the board that match a field and value
   - Parameters: `field` (field name/ID), `value` (value to search for)
   
4. **create_board_item**: Creates a new item in the board
   - Parameters: `item_name` (name of the item), `column_values` (values for columns), `group_id` (optional)
   
5. **update_board_item**: Updates an existing item
   - Parameters: `item_id` (item ID), `column_values` (values to update)

```

Or install all dependencies from the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Server connection error

Verify that:
- The server is running
- Environment variables are correctly configured
- Your Monday.com API key has the necessary permissions

## üìù Development

This project uses:
- **MCP** for server and client interface
- **Monday Python SDK** to interact with the Monday.com API
- **Python-dotenv** for configuration management
- **Requests** for HTTP communication
