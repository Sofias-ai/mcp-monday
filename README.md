# Monday.com MCP Integration

An integration between Monday.com and the MCP (Model Control Protocol) that allows managing and querying Monday.com boards through a standardized interface.

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A Monday.com account with an API key
- An existing board in Monday.com

## üîß Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv mcpMondayVenv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   mcpMondayVenv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Unix/macOS
   source mcpMondayVenv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Run the setup script or install dependencies manually:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use the setup script
   python setup.py
   
   # Option 2: Install dependencies manually
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```
   MONDAY_API_KEY=your_monday_api_key
   MONDAY_BOARD_ID=your_board_id
   ```
   
   You can get your API key in Monday.com ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí API ‚Üí API v2 Token

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

- `monday_config.py`: Configuration and initialization of MCP and Monday.com
- `monday_server.py`: MCP server for Monday.com
- `monday_tools.py`: MCP tools to operate with Monday.com
- `monday_resources.py`: MCP resources to query Monday.com data

## üöÄ Usage

### Start the server

You can run the server using different transport methods:

```bash
# Default (stdio)
python monday_server.py

# Explicitly specify transport
python monday_server.py --transport stdio
python monday_server.py --transport sse
```

## ‚ú® Features

- **Optimized GraphQL Queries**: Direct GraphQL queries for better performance
- **Smart Caching System**: 5-minute time-based cache to minimize API calls
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when GraphQL queries fail
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all functions
- **Windows Compatibility**: Built-in handling of Windows-specific encoding issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

The MCP integration offers these tools for interacting with Monday.com:

1. **get_board_schema** - Get the structure of the board (columns, groups, etc.) without items
   - Returns detailed information about columns, including dropdown options

2. **get_board_items** - Get only the items from the board
   - Retrieves all items with their column values efficiently

3. **get_board_data** - Combined schema and items in one call
   - Use with caution on large boards as it retrieves all data

4. **search_board_items** - Search for items by field and value
   - Parameters: `field` (field name/ID), `value` (value to search for)
   - Supports searching by column title or ID

5. **delete_board_items** - Delete items matching a field and value
   - Parameters: `field` (field name/ID), `value` (value to search for)
   - Returns detailed information about deleted items and any errors

6. **create_board_item** - Create a new item in the board
   - Parameters: `item_name` (name of the item), `column_values` (values for columns), `group_id` (optional)
   - Automatically uses first group if group_id not provided

7. **update_board_item** - Update an existing item
   - Parameters: `item_id` (item ID), `column_values` (values to update)

## üìö Available Resources

The server provides these resources that can be accessed through the MCP protocol:

- `monday://board/schema` - Complete board schema
- `monday://board/columns` - All columns in the board 
- `monday://board/columns/{column_id}` - Information about a specific column
- `monday://board/items` - All items in the board
- `monday://board/item/{item_id}` - Details of a specific item

## üèéÔ∏è Performance Optimizations

This integration includes several performance-enhancing features:

1. **Resource Caching**: All resources are cached for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
2. **GraphQL-First Approach**: Uses optimized GraphQL queries for better performance
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatically falls back to standard API when GraphQL fails
4. **Error Resilience**: Continues operation even when parts of the data can't be retrieved

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

Make sure you have all dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install requests monday python-dotenv mcp
```

Or install all dependencies from the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Server connection error

Verify that:
- The server is running (check the logs in monday_server.log)
- Environment variables are correctly configured in .env
- Your Monday.com API key has the necessary permissions
- The board ID exists and is accessible with your API key

### Windows encoding issues

If you encounter encoding problems on Windows, the server automatically configures binary mode and UTF-8 encoding for stdin/stdout. If problems persist, check your terminal's encoding settings.

## üìù Development

This project uses:
- **MCP** for server and client interface
- **Monday Python SDK** to interact with the Monday.com API
- **Python-dotenv** for configuration management
- **Custom GraphQL queries** for optimized data retrieval

### Extending the integration

To add new capabilities:
1. Add GraphQL queries in `monday_resources.py` if needed
2. Implement new tool functions in `monday_tools.py`
3. Create resource endpoints in `monday_resources.py` if necessary
